This is a training course on data visualisation skills for e61. 

**Presenter**: Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  She is a world leader in data visualisation, especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using tours with low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit.  She is currently focusing on bridging the gap between exploratory graphics and statistical inference.  Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, past editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, current editor of the R Journal, elected Board Member of the R Foundation, and elected member of the International Statistical Institute.

## Structure of training course

- Overview: what is the difference between communication and exploration?
- Creating communication graphics:

    - Grammatical descriptions of common plots.
    - Following cognitive perception principles, including credibility and colour.
    - Polishing your plots, by paying attention to the small things, and accessibility. 
    - Determining which plot is the most effective.
    - Incorporating uncertainty.
    - Working with multivariate, and temporal and spatial data.
- Plotting data for exploration:
    - Initial data analysis
