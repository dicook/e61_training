Website: [TO BE CREATED]()

This is a training course on data visualisation skills for e61. 

**Presenter**: Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  She is a world leader in data visualisation, especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using tours with low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit.  She is currently focusing on bridging the gap between exploratory graphics and statistical inference.  Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, past editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, current editor of the R Journal, elected Board Member of the R Foundation, and elected member of the International Statistical Institute.

## Structure of training course

- Overview: what is the difference between communication and exploration?
- Creating communication graphics:
    - Organising your data for efficient plot descriptions. 
    - Grammatical descriptions of common plots.
    - Following cognitive perception principles, including credibility and colour.
    - Polishing your plots, by paying attention to the small things, and accessibility. 
    - Determining which plot is the most effective.
    - Incorporating uncertainty.
    - Working with multivariate, and temporal and spatial data.
- Plotting data for exploration:
    - Initial data analysis
    - Expectations and what is possible
    - Adding interactivity
    - Creating null samples to assess the strength of patterns.

## Getting started

1. You should have a reasonably up to date version of R and R Studio, eg RStudio RStudio 2023.06.2 +561 and R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16). Install the following packages, and their dependencies.

```
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyr", "dplyr", "readr", "stringr", "nullabor", "colorspace", "palmerpenguins", "broom", "ggbeeswarm"), dependencies=c("Depends", "Imports"))
```

2. Download the [Zip file of materials](https://statsocaus.github.io/tutorial_effective_data_plots/tutorial.zip) to your laptop, and unzip it. 

3. Download just the R scripts, [slides1.R](https://statsocaus.github.io/tutorial_effective_data_plots/slides1.R), [slides2.R](https://statsocaus.github.io/tutorial_effective_data_plots/slides2.R)

4. Open your RStudio be clicking on `tutorial.Rproj`.
